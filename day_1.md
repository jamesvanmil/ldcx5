## Lightning talks

### IIIF - INstitutional Image Interoperability Framework

Stuart Snyderman - [http://iiif.io](http://iiif.io). Set of APIs for sharing images. Metadata API and image API. Close to two dozen instutions contributing. 

Simeon Warner - updaing impage API to 2.0. Working on presentation (metadata) API. Question about tooling for annotating images.

### DPLA metadata aggregration

25 different aggregators. Talk about aggregation stack - issues emerging from assumptions. No understanding of data form application. Interested in working with others about doing aggregation and reconciling with vocabularies. RDF is appealing. 

Jon Stroop - Princeton has a similar problem on a smaller scale. Resource Sync is an interesting solutions? Something to tag on?

Tom Cramer - Interested in Hydra or Fedora 4 as an API to expose resources.

### RDF and Hydra 7 

Active Fedora 7 came with overhaul of RDF - rewrote for that resources are modeled as a subgraph of a larger graph - Ruby wrapper around RDF to allow writing and persisting. Work around RDF in Fedora 4. Session is an opportunity to get everyone up to speed. Also working on a linked vocabs tool with SKOS, RDFS, or OWL for modeling and enforcement of vocabularies.
