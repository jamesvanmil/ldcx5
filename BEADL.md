# EAD in Blacklight
2014-04-22

Several efforts to handle EAD in Blacklight - opportunity to collaborate.

Is the focus on Finding Aids or on EAD? EAD is what we have to work with. Is the focus on Archivists or Researchers? Better to abstract up to hierarchically arranged collections. Blacklight could accomodate both Archivists and Researchers. Consensus to focus on researchers and public service staff.

Datasource: EAD? Other? Focus on hierarchical data in Blacklight is the requirement. Indexing of entire context, and relevancy across that context, is a challenge.
