Stanford interested in union catalog of geospatioal data. ResourceSync is better than OAI?

Stroop - New dark repo, but want to get metadata over to the catalog without doing it record-by-record; resourcesync seems perfect. Hydra community could take it on in a generalizable way with a few configuration options.

Mark - Hydra blacklight does a good job of human presentation, but we don't make the info nicely available in a machine readable format. ResourceSync is a good spec, and not Hydra-centric.

[tutorial](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/resourcesync/resources/)

Starting point is a sitemap list of resources. If you have a list of everything you can get everything, and audit it, and look at changes.

Core capabilities:
* Describe content
* Package content
* Describe changes
* Package content

Needs:
1. Baseline sync
2. Incremental sync
3. Audit

Essentially an extra index over your service.

Concerns about access controls. Create resource enpoints to correspond with classes of users?
