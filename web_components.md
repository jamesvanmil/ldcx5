# WebComponents in Blacklight
## 2014-04-22

Matt Zumwalt - [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) - Using Angular for DataBindery. Redering Blacklight stuff, e.g., facets, as webcompoments. Could use Spotlight to build something, and use the embed code to put somewhere else.

Client-side intereactions handled by these framework - can be seperate codebase supported by seperate test suite. Stub out APIs - can run many tests very quickly. Grunt is like rake, can be used to minify JS and run tests?

Potential for rich interaction with Blacklight content.

By building on Blacklight, we have a fallback for browsers without Javascript.
